# Washington Bike Demand Prediction

There are different bike companies such as Zagster and Lime Bikes that are present all over the US to ensure that people get rides as and when needed. As a result, there is an increase in demand for these bikes as some people move to these cost-efficient and environment friendly transport options. As a result of this transition, there is variation in the demand for bikes in different regions.

One of the challenges that these companies face is to know the number of bikes that must be placed at different locations at different instances of time to ensure that they get maximum profit and give the people their rides when needed. Sometimes there is a possibility of people missing out these bikes due to their unavailability. On the contrary, there are also instances where the demand for these bikes are low while they are highly available. It becomes important to tackle these instances and understand the demand for the bikes for different days and different scenarios. 

With the help of machine learning and deep learning, this problem could be addressed and this would ensure that the demand for the bikes are known beforehand and thus, the companies could ensure that there are adequate bikes present in different locations. 

Therefore, with the help of data visualization and machine learning, bike rental companies would be able to understand the total number of bikes that must be present at different instances of time and thus, they would be able to predict the demand for the bikes in the future. This would ensure that the companies save millions of dollars by giving the right service to different people who are in need. 

It is important to know some of the features that are present in the data so that we could be doing the machine learning analysis. We would be performing various data visualizations to understand some of the underlying features and once we get a good understanding of them, we are going to be using different machine learning models for predicting the demand for bikes based on these features. Once we get the machine learning predictions, we are going to be using different strategies that could aid us in the process of productionizing the models that could be used in different ways in companies. Therefore, this would save a lot of time and money for the bike rental companies where the demand for the bikes is predicted beforehand with the aid of machine learning and deep learning respectively.
