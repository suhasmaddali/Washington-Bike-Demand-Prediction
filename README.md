# Washington-Bike-Demand-Prediction

There are different bike companies such as Zagster and Lime Bikes that are present all over the US to ensure that people get rides as and when needed. As a result, there is an increase in demand for these bikes as some people move to these cost-efficient and environmental friendly transport options. Thus, the demand for these bike rental services would increase respectively.

One of the challenges that these companies face is to know the number of bikes that must be placed at different locations at different instances of time to ensure that they get maximum profit and give the people their rides when needed. Sometimes there is a possibility of people missing out these bikes due to their unavailability. On the contrary, there are also instances where the demand for these bikes are low while they are highly available. It becomes important to tackle these instances and understand the demand for the bikes for different days and different scenarios. 

With the help of machine learning and deep learning, this problem could be addressed and this would ensure that the demand for the bikes are known beforehand and thus, the companies could ensure that there are adequate bikes present in different locations. 

Therefore, with the help of data visualization and machine learning, bike rental companies would be able to understand the total number of bikes that must be present at different instances of time and thus, they would be able to predict the demand for the bikes in the future. This would ensure that the companies save millions of dollars by giving the right service to different people who are in need. 

Learning the different features that are present in our data is important when doing the machine learning analysis respectively. Therefore, we would be doing different data visualizations to understand the data that we are working with and see how well the machine learning models could be used later after getting insights from the data. Later, we would take a look at different machine learning algorithms that could be used for the predictions respectively. Once we get those predictions, we would be developing different strategies and ways at which the machine learning could be used for productivity respectively. Later, action could be taken based on the insights along with the machine learning predictions so that the companies save a lot of money and supply the bikes to different users as and when needed respectively.
