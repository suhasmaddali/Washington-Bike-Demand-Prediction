There are different bike companies such as Zagster and Lime Bikes present all over the US to ensure that people get rides when needed. As a result, there is an increase in demand for these bikes as some people move to these cost-efficient and environment friendly transport options. As a result of this transition, there is variation in the demand for bikes in different regions.

One of the challenges that these companies face is to know the number of bikes that must be placed at different locations at different instances of time to ensure that they get maximum profit and give the people their rides. Sometimes there is a possibility of people missing out these bikes due to their unavailability. On the contrary, there are also instances when the demand for these bikes are low while they are highly available. It becomes important to tackle these instances and understand the demand for the bikes for different days and scenarios. 

With the help of machine learning and deep learning, this problem could be addressed and this would ensure that the demand for the bikes are known beforehand and thus, the companies could ensure that there are adequate bikes present in different locations. 

Therefore, with the help of data visualization and machine learning, bike rental companies would be able to understand the total number of bikes that must be present at different instances of time and thus, they would be able to predict the demand for the bikes in the future. This would ensure that the companies save millions of dollars by giving the right service to different people who are in need. 

It is important to know some of the features that are present in the data so that we could be doing the machine learning analysis. We would be performing various data visualizations to understand some of the underlying features and once we get a good understanding of them, we are going to be using different machine learning models for predicting the demand for bikes based on these features. Once we get the machine learning predictions, we are going to be using different strategies that could aid us in the process of productionizing the models that could be used in different ways in companies. Therefore, this would save a lot of time and money for the bike rental companies where the demand for the bikes is predicted beforehand with the aid of machine learning and deep learning respectively. 

## Directions to download the repository and run the notebook 

1. You'll have to download and install Git that could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.
 
&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(14).png" width = "600"/>
 
2. Once "Git" is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to download this repository. I would like to store it in "Git Folder" location. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(15).png" width = "600" />

3. If you have successfully installed Git, you'll get an option called "Gitbash Here" when you right-click on a particular location. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(16).png" width = "600" />


4. Once the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then paste the link of the repository.
 
&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(18).png" width = "600" />

5. The link of the repository can be found when you click on "Code" (Green button) and then, there would be a html link just below. Therefore, the command to download a particular repository should be "Git clone html" where the html is replaced by the link to this repository. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(17).png" width = "600" />

6. After successfully downloading the repository, there should be a folder with the name of the repository as can be seen below.

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(19).png" width = "600" />

7. Once the repository is downloaded, go to the start button and search for "Anaconda Prompt" if you have anaconda installed. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(20).png" width = "600" />

8. Later, open the jupyter notebook by writing "jupyter notebook" in the Anaconda prompt. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(21).png" width = "600" />

9. Now the following would open with a list of directories. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(22).png" width = "600" />

10. Search for the location where you have downloaded the repository. Be sure to open that folder. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(12).png" width = "600" />

10. You might now run the .ipynb files present in the repository to open the notebook and the python code present in it.
